This library is a middle ground between the features of raw Clojure spec and George Lipov's Ghostwheel. I
personally wanted the following features, so I implemented them. Much of the source code in this
library is directly from https://github.com/gnl/ghostwheel[Ghostwheel].

The new code in this library is copyrighted by Fulcrologic, LLC.  The code derived from Ghostwheel is
